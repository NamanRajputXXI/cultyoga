ABOUT THE PROJECT  -  Our project aims to revolutionize personal wellness through an innovative yoga platform. We're developing a comprehensive web and mobile app that not only showcases a vast library of yoga poses and their benefits but also features a unique 'Cure by Yoga' functionality. Users can effortlessly search for specific health concerns or ailments, and our backend intelligently fetches tailored yoga recommendations to address these issues.

Built on cutting-edge technologies like React.js for dynamic frontend experiences and React Native for seamless mobile compatibility, our platform ensures a user-friendly interface across devices. Node.js with Express.js powers our backend, supporting secure user authentication and scalable data management with MongoDB.

This project isn't just about yoga; it's about empowering users with personalized health solutions. Whether you're a beginner exploring yoga benefits or someone seeking targeted therapeutic support, our app will guide you through every step, including video tutorials and progress tracking. Join us in creating a holistic wellness tool that merges ancient wisdom with modern technology for a healthierÂ world.
